            I'm Jesse <br />A developer / designer <br /> with a love for smooth

            A background in music and arts has awarded me with 20+ years of work
            in creative disciplines. My time currently revolves around front-end
            development and honing my skills in HTML, CSS, and React.js. Most
            recently, Iâ€™ve developed a passion for all things Web3, including
            cryptocurrencies, NFTs, DeFi, GameFi, decentralization, and the
            implications of blockchains on day-to-day life. Outside of tech, my
            love of family, music, cooking, and the great outdoors keeps me
            fully occupied.
